# Mongodb BI Connector

This is experimental docker image for mongodb-bi-connector using a custom aggregation pipeline from https://github.com/bartpolot/drdl-class-aggregation

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION, IT WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE AND MAKE YOUR CHILDREN VEGAN

## Security / Auth

This bi-connector assume that your mongodb server can connect without any authentication (trusted network).
"*Authentication in MongoDB is fairly complex*". Thats the reason to make this bi-connector is simple as possible for now.
Again, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION, IT WILL POISON YOUR DOG AND BRICK YOUR PHONE
